# Item Searcher

## Description

Adds a convenient method to make characters search for specific items in nearby containers

## Compatibility

This mod should be compatible with any build 41 code (developed and tested with 41.65-41.68), but has not been specifically tested for Build 40.

## Usage

The main Item Searcher UI is bound to the single/double quote key (usually next to Enter on QWERTY keyboards). Press the key to open the UI, type the item you're searching for, and press Enter to find the item. If you enter a term which is ambiguous, double-click an entry in the item list to select it for searching, or provide another search term. Click "Start Searching" and your character is off to the races!
